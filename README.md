    Welcome to my second capstone.  The backend file is called kfg-backend.  Once the backend is running, our frontend can be used.  This application can be used by employees at my current employer, Korhorn Financial Group(KFG).  KFG is a quickly growing company, and many new hires as well as those that have been there for a while have expressed how hard it is to know who to go to when they run into a specific problem. This app will help solve this problem.

    First, a user must create a username and password to use the application.  Once signed in, the navigation bar will allow them to click a link for Team Members or Skills Needed.  When arriving at either page, they will see a list of all employees, or all skills, respectively.  They can go through and click on a user or skill to see more details.  If they are not sure what or who to click on, they can use the search bar to help them.  Once the results are narrowed down a bit, they can click and get the info they need.  Once they are on the Employee Card for the employee they need, they can retrieve contact information such as phone extension, email address, or Microsoft Teams contact name.  If they click on the email address, it will launch a window to send an email to the employee.  Same if they click on the Teams Link.  It will automatically begin a conversation window with the Employee on Teams.

    One neat feature is when they get an Employee Detail card, they can see the contact information, as well as all the various skills that the employee has.  Similar situation when the user gets to a certain Skill detail card.  In addition to providing a description of the skill, they can see a list of all employees that have that particular skill.  

    Finally, when a user is logged in, they may edit their profile and change their first or last name or email address. Once they have retrieved all the information they came searching for, they may log out of the application.  

    Enjoy!
