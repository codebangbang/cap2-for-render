# Project Ideas - I am leaning towards using project #1.  

In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of!

1. An employee directory for the company that I currently work at - Allow a new employee to sign in and search for someone that has a certain skill or experience on something that they need help with.  They can search and find the employee, and then there will be contact information for the new employee to reach out and ask for help.  There will be an API to chat via Teams with the employee, possibly an API to our IP based phone system that would allow them to call the coworker as well?  Of course email will be available as well.  

2. An inventory tracking website/database - I have a collection of antiques that I have collected over the years.  I have a separate insurance policy on these collectibles.  Every so often, I have to provide a document to the insurance company telling them what I have and what they are insuring. 

3. A tax projection calculator tool - Create a tool that would accept user input of estimated income, deductions, and credits for the current year to come up with an approximate amount due or refund if assumptions are correct.
